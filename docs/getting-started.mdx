## Installation

In this section, we will walk you through the process of installing Aetheria on your local machine or server.
We will also cover alternative installation methods such as Docker and package managers.

:::note
Development setup differs from production setup, consider cloning the
[official Aetheria monorepo](https://github.com/override-sh/aetheria) for development purposes.

### System requirements for running Aetheria

Aetheria requires the following dependencies to be installed on your system:

- Node.js (latest LTS or higher) <sup>1</sup>
- Node package manager <sup>2</sup>
- MongoDB <sup>3</sup>
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.) <sup>4</sup>
- NestJs cli (headless only) <sup>5</sup>

:::note Notes on requirements
<details>
<summary>Node.js <sup>1</sup></summary>

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside a browser.
You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or
using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (**suggested**)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Node package manager <sup>2</sup></summary>

There are many node package managers the most commonly used are `npm`, `yarn` and `pnpm`. You can install
`npm` by installing Node.js or by following the instructions on the official [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Alternatively, you can install `yarn` by following the instructions on the official
[yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Currently, `pnpm` is not officially supported by Aetheria due to its way of managing deeply nested dependencies,
this
may change in the future as we strongly think that Aetheria will benefit from `pnpm` powerful tree reorganization.

</details>
<details>
<summary>MongoDB <sup>3</sup></summary>

Currently Aetheria only supports MongoDB as a database, you can install MongoDB by following the instructions on the
official [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Even though MongoDB can be installed on a local machine we strongly discourage this practice as it is not secure and
will not scale well, instead we suggest using a cloud provider such
as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
for production environments or using the attached `docker-compose.yml` file for development environments.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Unix-like operating system <sup>4</sup></summary>

Aetheria is built on top of two frameworks, Nest.js and Next.js, as they are both built on top of Node.js they are
platform-agnostic, however, due to the optimization made by Aetheria's to the plugin system, we strongly suggest
using
a Unix-like operating system such as Linux, macOS or WSL.

One of the main reasons for this is that Aetheria uses symlinks to link plugins to the main application, this may
not
be fully supported on Windows and may require additional configuration.

This is valid for development but is mostly a strict requirement for production environments.

</details>
<details>
<summary>NestJs cli <sup>5</sup></summary>

The NestJs cli is a command-line interface that allows you to generate NestJs applications and modules, it eases
the development process by providing a set of commands that can be used to generate boilerplate code and manage
dependencies, build the app and start development server.
This is only required for the headless version of Aetheria, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

</details>
