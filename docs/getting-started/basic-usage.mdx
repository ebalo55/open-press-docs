# Basic Usage

In this section, we will explore the fundamental functionalities and workflows of Aetheria, enabling you to effectively
utilize the CMS and create exceptional websites.

## Logging into the Aetheria dashboard

:::info
In order to log in to the Aetheria dashboard, you must have the CMS (frontend and backend) installed and running on your
system.

If you have not yet installed Aetheria, please refer to the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation).
:::

Upon the initial installation, Aetheria automatically sets up a default user with the email `john.doe@example.com` and
password `password`.

You can use these credentials to log in to the CMS and begin your journey with Aetheria.
We highly recommend changing the default user's credentials for security purposes once you have access to the CMS.

If you're using the official frontend, you can access the login page by navigating to `http://<your-domain>/admin` or
clicking on one of the two blue buttons.

The following form will be displayed letting you enter your credentials and log into the CMS.

## Overview of the user interface and navigation

The base installation of Aetheria includes two essential modules: the `User` module and the `Templates` module.
The `User` module provides functionalities related to authentication, and basic profile settings while the `Templates`
module allows you to manage and customize the website's templates for your content.

Upon logging in, users are directed to the template listing page, where they can begin creating and managing their
website's content using the available templates.

![Base dashboard](../../static/img/basic-usage/dashboard.png)

A default template named `home` is automatically created upon installation, and it is used to render the website's
homepage.
You can create additional templates to render other pages of your website, such as the `about` page, the `contact` page,
etc.

:::caution
The `home` template is automatically assigned to the homepage of your website, it can be deleted, but it should not as
otherwise the Next.js index page will be errored.

> This behavior will be subject to change as of [v1.1.x](/roadmap).
:::

## Creating and managing content

New templates can be created by clicking on the `New Template` button in the top right corner of the template listing,
this will open a new empty template in the editor.

It's important to note that the template's name must be unique, and that (at least in the base installation) the name
acts as the slug of the page, so it must be URL-friendly.

:::info Additional specification about the template name
If you're using the default frontend (**suggested**) the template name will be used to match the page's route, so if you
create a template named `about` the page will be accessible at `http://<your-domain>/about`.

Check out the following examples:

- `home` will be accessible at `http://<your-domain>/`
- `about` will be accessible at `http://<your-domain>/about`
- `contact` will be accessible at `http://<your-domain>/contact`
- `blog/post-slug` will be accessible at `http://<your-domain>/blog/post-slug`
- `blog/2023-06-22/post-slug` will be accessible at `http://<your-domain>/blog/2023-06-22/post-slug`
:::

:::caution
A known bug exists in the method used to match the page's route.

Creating 3 templates named `example`, `example/` and `example/index.html` with 3 different pages, respectively
rendered at `http://<your-domain>/example`, `http://<your-domain>/example/`
and `http://<your-domain>/example/index.html`.

The problem arises due to the fact that path ending with a slash are treated as directories, and the `index.html` file
is treated as the index file of the directory, so you would expect `http://<your-domain>/example/`
and `http://<your-domain>/example/index.html` to render the same page, but they don't.

Due to modern browser optimization and the fact that the `index.html` file doesn't really exists, the browser will
automatically redirect the user from `http://<your-domain>/example/` to `http://<your-domain>/example` finally resulting
in the render of the template named `example` instead of `example/`.

This means that the template named `example/` will never be rendered, and the template named `example/index.html` will
be rendered only if the user manually types the URL in the browser including the ending `index.html`.

> This behavior will be subject to change as of [v1.1.x](/roadmap).
