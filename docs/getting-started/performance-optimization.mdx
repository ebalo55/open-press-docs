# Performance Optimization

This documentation page will guide you through the performance optimization techniques and best practices for Aetheria.
By implementing these optimizations, you can ensure optimal speed, efficiency, and responsiveness for your website.

## Built-in Performance Optimizations

Aetheria incorporates several performance optimizations by default, which contribute to a fast and efficient CMS
experience.

### Minimal Base Installation:

The base installation of Aetheria includes only the strictly required functionalities.
This approach helps reduce the overall bundle size, resulting in faster loading times and improved performance.

### Template Pre-rendering

Templates in Aetheria are pre-rendered each time they are updated.

This ensures that the latest version of the template is readily available and eliminates the need for unnecessary
requests to the backend, enhancing overall performance.

### Server-side Rendering with Next.js

Aetheria leverages Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) of its pages.

By utilizing server-side components, Aetheria enables efficient pre-rendering and optimization of metadata, leading to
improved performance and SEO benefits.

### ETag Usage

Aetheria utilizes ETags, or entity tags, to optimize caching and avoid unnecessary requests to both the frontend and the
backend.

ETags allow for efficient content validation, reducing bandwidth usage and improving response times.

### Image Optimization

Aetheria uses the `next/image` component to optimize images.

This component automatically resizes and compresses images to the optimal size, resulting in faster loading times and
improved performance.

### Lazy Loading

Aetheria implements lazy loading for images and other assets.

This technique ensures that only the required assets are loaded, reducing the overall bandwidth usage and loading times.

### Code Splitting

Aetheria utilizes code splitting to optimize the loading of JavaScript bundles. This technique allows for the
distribution of JavaScript code across multiple files, which are then loaded on demand. 

This approach helps reduce the initial loading time of the website, resulting in lower FCP/LCP.

### Automatic Static Optimization

Aetheria automatically optimizes static pages by pre-rendering them at build time. 

This technique ensures that the static pages are readily available, eliminating the need for unnecessary requests to the
backend.

### Templates minification

Aetheria minifies the templates at build time, reducing their overall size and improving performance.

### Client side request caching

Aetheria caches the requests made to the backend on the client side, reducing the overall bandwidth usage and the loading
times between pages and subsequent requests.

## Additional Performance Optimization Techniques

Apart from the built-in optimizations, users can implement additional techniques to further enhance the overall
performance of their Aetheria-based websites:

### CDN Deployment

Deploying the Aetheria frontend using a content delivery network (CDN), such as Cloudflare, can significantly improve
performance.

CDNs distribute your website's assets across multiple global servers, ensuring faster content delivery to users
worldwide.

### Horizontal Scaling of the Backend

To handle high traffic or large datasets, you can horizontally scale the Aetheria backend.
This involves adding more server instances to your infrastructure, allowing for better load distribution and improved
performance.

Implementing these performance optimization techniques will help you deliver a seamless and lightning-fast user
experience for your Aetheria-powered websites.

By combining the built-in optimizations with additional strategies, you can ensure that your website performs optimally
under various conditions.
