# Prerequisites

Prerequisites for using Aetheria strongly depend on your use case and level of expertise.
None of the prerequisites are mandatory, but they can help you get the most out of Aetheria.

The plugin marketplace offers a wide range of plugins that can help you achieve your goals without any additional
effort.

Let's take a look at some of the prerequisites that will help you get the most out of Aetheria:

- **Basic Web Development Knowledge**: While Aetheria offers a user-friendly interface, having a foundational
  understanding of web development concepts such as HTML and CSS will help you make the most out of the customization
  options and advanced features.
- **Familiarity with Node.js and React**: Aetheria's backend is built on Nest.js (a Node.js framework) and the frontend
  utilizes Next.js (a React framework).
  Having a basic understanding of these technologies will enable you to better navigate and customize Aetheria's
  architecture and develop tailored plugins.
- **Server Environment**: To deploy and host Aetheria, you will need a server environment that supports Node.js and the
  required dependencies.
  This can be a local development environment or a hosting provider that supports Node.js applications.
