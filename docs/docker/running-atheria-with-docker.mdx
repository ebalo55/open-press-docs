# Running Aetheria with Docker

In this chapter, we will guide you through the process of running Aetheria in a Docker environment.
By following these steps, you will be able to set up and deploy Aetheria with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed and properly configured for your operating system.
  You can download Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation instructions
  specific to your platform.

## Obtaining Aetheria Docker Images

To run Aetheria with Docker, we provide pre-built Docker images for [different presets](presets/README.mdx).
Each image contains all the necessary components and dependencies.
These images are available on the Docker Hub, making it convenient to pull and use them in your environment.

To obtain the Aetheria Docker images, open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
docker pull overridesoft/aetheria-headless:latest-<preset>
```

This command will fetch the latest version of the Aetheria Docker image and store it locally on your system.

## Configuring Aetheria with Docker Compose

To simplify the setup and configuration process, we provide a Docker Compose configuration file that defines the
required services and their configurations. Docker Compose allows you to manage multi-container applications and define
their interdependencies.

1. Create a new directory for your Aetheria project, if you haven't done so already.

2. Inside the project directory, create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`.

3. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in a text editor and copy the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    # The frontend image is not available as a Docker image. You will need to build it locally.
    # See the "Building frontend images" chapter for instructions.
    image: aetheria-frontend:latest
    environment:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME: Aetheria
      NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL: http://headless:3001
    depends_on:
      - headless
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

  headless:
    image: overridesoft/aetheria-headless:latest-base
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DB_HOST: mongo
      DB_PORT: 27017
      DB_USERNAME: <mongo-db-username>
      DB_PASSWORD: <mongo-db-password>
      DB_DATABASE: aetheria

      JWT_ENCRYPTION: "symmetric"
      JWT_SECRET: "<randomly-generate-a-key>"
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: <mongo-db-username>
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: <mongo-db-password>
```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

:::note Docker compose configuration
The above configuration contains placeholders for the MongoDB username and password, the preset and the jwt secret.
You will need to replace these placeholders with your own values.
You can also change the port mappings if necessary.

The configuration above is defined as an example for common presets.
:::

:::info Environment variables
The `environment` section of the configuration defines the environment variables for each service.
These variables are used to configure the services and define their behavior.

You can find a list of all available environment variables for your preset in the preset's page.

## Starting Aetheria with Docker Compose

To start Aetheria with Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you created the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Execute the following command to start Aetheria:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will start the Aetheria and MongoDB containers in detached mode, running them in the background.

3. Wait for the containers to start and initialize. You can monitor the progress by viewing the logs with the following
   command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

4. Once Aetheria has started successfully, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating
   to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Aetheria interface.

Congratulations! You have successfully run Aetheria with Docker.
You can now begin exploring its features and start building your websites using this powerful and flexible CMS.
