# Blog Preset

:::caution Work in progress
This preset is currently a work in progress.

A generator is not yet available for this preset, and some features might not be fully implemented or optimized.
:::

The *blog* preset is designed specifically for creating and managing blog websites.
It includes additional features and configurations optimized for blog-style content, such as article management,
categories, tags, and author profiles.

Once the official releases are ready you can use the blog preset by pulling the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull overridesoft/aetheria-headless:latest-blog
```

Versions of the *blog* preset are also available for specific Aetheria versions. To pull a specific version, append the
version number to the image name, for example:

```bash
docker pull overridesoft/aetheria-headless:1.0.0-blog
```

## Frontend blog preset

Due to the nature of the optimization process in place in the frontend, the frontend image is not available as a Docker
image.
However, you can still use the frontend image with Docker by building the frontend preset locally and running it with
the *blog* backend preset.

To build the frontend preset, follow the instructions in the [Building frontend images](../building-frontend-images.mdx)
chapter.
