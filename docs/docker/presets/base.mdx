# Base Preset

The *base* preset provides the core functionality of Aetheria, making it suitable for general-purpose website
development. It includes essential features and components for content management, template creation, and website
customization.

To use the *base* preset, pull the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull overridesoft/aetheria-headless:latest-base
```

Versions of the *base* preset are also available for specific Aetheria versions. To pull a specific version, append the
version number to the image name, for example:

```bash
docker pull overridesoft/aetheria-headless:1.0.0-base
```

## Frontend base preset

Due to the nature of the optimization process in place in the frontend, the frontend image is not available as a Docker
image.
However, you can still use the frontend image with Docker by building the frontend preset locally and running it with
the *base* backend preset.

To build the frontend preset, follow the instructions in the [Building frontend images](../building-frontend-images.mdx)
chapter.

## Environment variables

The base preset includes only the most essential environment variables. For a complete list of environment variables,
see the [Configuration](../../getting-started/configuration.mdx#configuration-options) chapter in the documentation.
