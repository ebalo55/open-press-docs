# Building frontend images

In this chapter, we will guide you through the process of building the frontend preset locally and running it with its
corresponding backend preset.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Docker**: Make sure you have Docker installed and properly configured for your operating system.
  You can download Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation instructions
  specific to your platform.
- **Your chosen backend preset**: You will need to build the frontend preset locally and run it with its corresponding
  backend preset.
  For example, if you want to build the *base* frontend preset, you will need to run it with the *base*
  backend preset.

:::info Backend preset
You may host the backend preset on a remote server and run the frontend preset building locally.

However, for the purposes of this guide, we will assume that you are running both the frontend and backend presets
locally.

## Building the image

:::note Preset name
For the sake of simplicity, we will use the *base* preset as an example in this guide.

Feel free to replace the preset name with your chosen preset name.
:::

To build the frontend preset, you should use the builtin command provided with the `@aetheria/cli` package.

The installation of the is as ease as running the following command:

```bash title="Installing the @aetheria/cli package"
npm install -g @aetheria/cli
```

This will install the `aetheria` command globally on your system.

Once the installation is complete, you can run the following command to build the frontend preset:

```bash title="Building the frontend preset from monorepo folder"
aetheria docker build frontend base -f ../frontend/
```

This command will build the frontend preset and tag it with the `overridesoft/aetheria-frontend:base` tag.

### Command pragma

The command above may be unclear as lots of assumptions are made. Let's break it down:

- `aetheria docker build`: This is the command that instructs the `aetheria` CLI to build a Docker image.
- `frontend`: This is the type of the image that we want to build. In this case, we want to build a frontend image. You
  can also build a backend image by replacing `frontend` with `backend`.
- `base`: This is the preset name. You can replace it with your chosen preset name.
- `-f ../frontend/`: This is the path to the frontend project folder. You can replace it with your own path. In the
  above example, we assume that the frontend project folder is located relative to the cli project in the official
  monorepo.
  If you are building the frontend from within the frontend project you may replace it, for example, with `.`.

More information about the `aetheria docker build` command can be found in the [CLI reference](../cli/docker/build.mdx).
