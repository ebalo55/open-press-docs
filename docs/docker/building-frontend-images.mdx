- **Docker**: Make sure you have Docker installed and properly configured for your operating system.
  You can download Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation instructions
  specific to your platform.
- **Your chosen backend preset**: You will need to build the frontend preset locally and run it with its corresponding
  backend preset.
