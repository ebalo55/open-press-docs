# Overview

## Introduction to Docker and Containerization

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment and scaling of applications using
containerization.
Containers provide a lightweight and portable solution for packaging software, along with its dependencies, into a
single unit.

By using Docker, you can ensure consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments, making it easier
to manage and deploy applications.

## Benefits of Running Aetheria with Docker

Running Aetheria with Docker offers several advantages:

1. **Isolation**: Aetheria runs in its own isolated container, separating it from the underlying system and other
   applications. This isolation provides improved security and stability.

2. **Portability**: Docker containers are portable, meaning you can easily run Aetheria on different platforms, such as
   development machines, staging servers, or production environments, without worrying about compatibility issues.

3. **Scalability**: Docker makes it straightforward to scale Aetheria horizontally by running multiple instances of the
   container. This allows you to handle increased traffic and workload demands effectively.

4. **Version Control**: With Docker, you can version and manage different releases of Aetheria, making it easier to roll
   back to previous versions if needed.

## Aetheria's Support for Docker

Aetheria has been designed to work seamlessly with Docker, providing an optimized and container-ready solution for
building and managing websites. 
The Aetheria project provides Docker images with different presets, Docker Compose configurations, and
documentation to help you run Aetheria effortlessly in a Docker environment.

In the next chapter, we will walk you through the process of running Aetheria with Docker, including the necessary setup
and configuration steps.
